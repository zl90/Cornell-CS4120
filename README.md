# Cornell-CS4120
I'm taking Cornell University's "Introduction to Compilers" course. Follow along with me!

#### 01 - Course Overview
My study session: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8bg22j2Yt4

In this lesson we get a high-level view of the main components of a compiler, including lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, code optimization and machine dependent phases. We learn the difference between the frontend and backend of a compiler.

#### 02 - Supplemental reading

In this lesson we go through the supplemental readings from the Dragon book. We delve deeper into the way tokens are represented, and we learn about a fundamentally important data structure used throughout most of the compilation process: the Symbol Table. We also see more examples of Intermediate Representation of code, and during the study session I show an example of breaking down the individual steps used in the G++ compiler.

#### 03 - Lexical Analysis and Regular Expressions
My study session: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2VPWksZGIE

We go into more depth on how modern lexers tokenize input streams. We start learning the notation and arithmetic surrounding Regular Expressions and discern how Regular Expressions help solve common problems with lexers (such as overlapping tokens and lookahead issues).
